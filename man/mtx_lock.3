.Sh NAME
.Nm mtx_lock
.Nd acquire a mutex
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb threads
.In threads.h
.Ft int
.Fn mtx_lock "mtx_t *mtx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn mtx_lock
will acquire a mutex
.Fa mtx .
If the mutex is already acquired by an other thread the function
will wait until the mutex can be acquired.
.Pp
If the mutex is already being held by the current thread and locking recursion
was not specified to
.Xr mtx_init 3
the thread will be in a deadlock. If recursion is enabled the thread will
acquire an additional instance of the mutex.
In this case to unlock the mutex
.Xr mtx_unlock 3
must be called an equal number of times as
.Fn mtx_lock ,
.Xr mtx_trylock 3 or
.Xr mtx_timedlock 3
have been called from the same thread on the same mutex,
in order to unlock the mutex for other threads.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success
.Fn mtx_lock
will return 
.Va thrd_success .
In case of error
.Va thrd_error
will be returned.
